# Introduction

Welcome to .ease documentation. This is still a work in progress.

## What is .ease?

**.ease** is an eslint package designed by students to simplify the process of producing accessible HTML code. This innovative tool assists developers in ensuring that their web pages adhere to accessibility guidelines, making them more **inclusive** and **user-friendly** for individuals with disabilities.
With **.ease**, developers can easily identify potential accessibility issues within their codebase, such as missing alt attributes for images, improper semantic structure, or inadequate color contrast.
By integrating **.ease** into their development workflow, programmers can proactively address accessibility concerns during the coding phase, ultimately saving time and effort in the long run.
This package not only empowers developers to create accessible websites but also promotes a more inclusive web experience for all users.
